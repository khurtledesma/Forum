User stories:
1. As a pet owner, I would like to be able to browse different categories so I am able find topics I am looking for.
2. As a forum user, I would like to be able to leave a comment on others posts so we are able to start conversations.
3. As a forum user, I would like to be able to login using my email address as I tend to forget my usernames.

Features I would like to add in the future:
1. Be able to see all posts by a user.
2. Delete/edit comments.
3. Add customizable avatars for users.
4. Add images to posts.
